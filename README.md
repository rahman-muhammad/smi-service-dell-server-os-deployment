### How to use

#### Startup

1) On the host system that runs docker, create a directory and mount a remote NFS or CIFS share. Example:
~~~
sudo mkdir /mnt/filesFromFs01
sudo mount 100.100.100.100:/opt/dell/public /mnt/filesFromFs01
~~~

2) Use docker run with the -v option to use the mount above inside of the container.  Example:
~~~
sudo docker run --name osdeployment -p 0.0.0.0:46014:46014 -v /mnt/filesFromFs01:/public -d rackhd/dell-os-deployment:latest
